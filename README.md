Prepr's Front End Developer Challenge
--------------

The task is to redesign a few key pages of the Prepr Network.

Reimagine and create frontend webpages of the following pages (and possible sub-pages):

* Explore page (https://preprlabs.org/)

* Projects page (https://preprlabs.org/myProjects)

* Challenges page (https://preprlabs.org/list/challenge)

* Challenge details page (https://preprlabs.org/challengeManager/front-end-developer-work-challenge)

* Labs page (https://preprlabs.org/joinedLab)

Do not be restrained by the current design and layout of the pages. However, do ensure that pages can perform their respective functions. Feel free to add additional details and functions, anything that you believe will result in the best user experience.

You may use any frontend technologies you want. You do not need to create any backend functionality (you can hardcode details and images into the web pages).

Submission Process: 

Please begin by creating a Project. 
Your Project should contain both the final output and a Github link to your source code. Please name all of your files and documents using the following convention:
